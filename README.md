# Æternity identity

The identity provider is a relatively simple app, that allows apps, which are loaded
via an iframe to interact with the ethereum network by providing an web3 instance.
To make this happen only a couple of things need to be paid attention to; first of
all apps need to be run on localhost, <subdomain>.aepps.com or <subdomain>.aepps.dev
for security reasons. To get a web3 instance which talks to the identity aepp you
need to use the [@aeternity/id-manager-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aeternity/id-manager-provider/).

```javascript
import IdManagerProvider from '@aeternity/id-manager-provider'
// ...
function initWeb3() {
    let web3;
    let idManager = new IdManagerProvider()
    idManager.checkIdManager().then( (idManagerPresent) => {
        if (idManagerPresent ) {
            web3 = new Web3(idManager.web3.currentProvider)
        } else if (typeof window.web3 !== 'undefined') { // Metamask
            web3 = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider);
        } else {
            web3 = null;
        }

        if (web3) {
            // Ready
        } else {
            // Not Ready
        }

    })
}
```

You also need to make sure that there are no synchronous calls to any of the web3
functions which issue API calls, e.g. instead of `web3.eth.accounts` use `web.eth.getAccounts(function (err, accounts) {...})`.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at http://localhost:8080/
npm run serve

# serve with hot reload at https://localhost:8080/
npm run serve -- --https

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build -- --report

# run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

## Contributing

We use the [gitflow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) workflow [this is also helpful](https://gist.github.com/JamesMGreene/cdd0ac49f90c987e45ac).
* Development of features happens in branches made from **develop** called feature/<the-feature> like feature/show-token-balance.
* When development is finished a pull request to **develop** is created. At least one person has to review the PR and when everything is fine the PR gets merged.
* The develop branch gets deployed to the [stage environment](https://stage-identity.aepps.com) by travis.
* To make a new release create a release branch called release/vX.X.X, also bump the version number in package.json in this branch.
* Create a PR to master which then also has to be accepted.
* Create a tag for this version and push the tag.
* Also merge back the changes (like the version bump) into develop.
* The master branch is deployed to the [live environment](https://identity.aepps.com) by travis.

## Live vs. Stage

We have a stage (develop) and a live (master) branch and environments where these branches will be deployed to.
* [stage environment](https://stage-identity.aepps.com)
* [live environment](https://identity.aepps.com)

### stage
* Is used to see changes to the code in effect in a "real" environment without the fear of breaking the live environment.
* http and https are allowed
* The URL of dapps running in the identity manager is not checked
* Some of our æpps included in the identity manager point to the staging version of those æpps (e.g. [notary stage](https://stage-notary.aepps.com))

### live
* Is the live environment, code lives in the "master" branch
* https is enforced
* dapps must use https

### Developing with the identity manager

Since the accepted URLs are very restricted and https is enforced you can use the stage environment during development. You need to configure the [id-manager-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aeternity/id-manager-provider/) to either use the stage environment by changing the *idManagerHost* option during initialization or passing the *skipSecurity* option.
